  <h3>General advisories</h3>

  <p>This Developer Preview release is for app developers only and is designed 
  for use in compatibility testing and early development only.</p>

  <h3>Wear 2.0 Notifications</h3>

  <h4>Notification groups</h4>

  <p>The current release of Android Wear 2.0 does not include support for notification
  groups, also known as <a href="{@docRoot}training/wearables/notifications/stacks.html">
  stacks</a> and bundles. You should continue to use notification groups because
   that support will be coming in a future version of Android Wear 2.0.</p>

   <h4>Smart Reply</h4>

   <p>The current version of Wear 2.0 does not generate any Smart Reply responses
    even if you call <a href="https://android-dot-devsite.googleplex.com/wear/preview/start.html#get_the_preview_reference_documentation">{@code setAllowGeneratedReplies()}</a>.
    This functionality will be added in a later version of Wear 2.0.
    </p>

  <h4>Fields that are deprecated in Wear 2.0</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Notification.WearableExtender#setCustomSizePreset(int) no longer accepts
    SIZE_FULL_SCREEN as it has no meaning in Wear 2.0.</li>

    <li>Notification.WearableExtender#setContentIcon(int) is deprecated as it has no
    meaning in Wear 2.0.</li>
  </ul>
