<p>The Android SDK Manager separates the SDK tools, platforms, and other components into packages
for easy access and management. You can also customize which sites the SDK Manager checks for new
or updated SDK packages and add-on tools. For example, you can configure the SDK Manager
to automatically check for updates and notify you when updates are available.
When you receive such a notification, you can then quickly decide whether to download the changes.  </p>

<h2 id="updatecheck">Enabling Automatic Update Checking</h2>
<p>To enable automatic update checking: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>
    &gt; <strong>Appearance & Behavior</strong> &gt; <strong>System Settings</strong>
    &gt; <strong>Updates</strong>. </li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Automatically check updates for</strong> checkbox and select an
    <ahref="{@docRoot}tools/studio/studio-config.html#update-channel">update channel</a>.</li>


  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> or <strong>Apply</strong> to enable the update checking. </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="run">Running the SDK Manager</h2>
<p>You can launch the SDK Manager in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From the Android Studio <strong>File</strong> menu:  <strong>File</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance & Behavior</strong> &gt;
    <strong>System Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Android SDK</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the Android Studio <strong>Tools</strong> menu: <strong>Tools</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Android</strong> &gt; <strong>SDK Manager</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the SDK Manager icon
    (<img src="{@docRoot}images/tools/sdk-manager-studio.png" style="vertical-align:sub;margin:0;height:17px" alt="" />)
    in the menu bar.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The SDK Manager appears.</p>
<img src="{@docRoot}images/tools/studio-sdk-manager-packages.png" alt="" />
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> The Android SDK Manager shows the
SDK platforms and packages that are available and installed along with the SDK update sites.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> The standalone SDK Manager is still available from the
command line, but we recommend it for use with standalone SDK installations only.</p>

<p>Click the checkbox next to
each additional SDK platform and tool that you want to install. Clear the
checkbox to uninstall an SDK platform or tool. Click <strong>Apply</strong> or <strong>OK</strong>
to update the packages and tools. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> When an update is available for an installed
package, a hyphen (-) appears in the checkbox next to the package. A download icon
(<img src="{@docRoot}images/tools/studio-sdk-dwnld-icon.png" style="vertical-align:sub;margin:0;height:17px" alt="" />)
also appears next
to the checkbox to indicate the pending update. An update icon
(<img src="{@docRoot}images/tools/studio-sdk-removal-icon.png" style="vertical-align:sub;margin:0;height:17px" alt="" />) appears next to the checkbox to
indicate pending removals.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>SDK Update Sites</strong> tab to manage which SDK sites Android Studio checks for
tool and add-on updates. </p>



<p>There are several different packages available for the Android SDK. The following section describes
most of the available packages and where they're located in your SDK directory
after you download them.</p>



<h2 id="Recommended">Recommended Packages</h2>

<p>Here's an outline of the packages required and those we recommend you use:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>SDK Tools</dt>
  <dd><strong>Required.</strong> Your new SDK installation installs the latest version. Be sure
    to respond to the Android Studio update prompts to keep your SDK Tools up-to-date.</dd>
  <dt>SDK Platform-tools</dt>
  <dd><strong>Required.</strong> Your new SDK installation installs the latest stable version.
    Be sure to respond to the Android Studio update prompts to keep your SDK Platform-tools
    up-to-date.</dd>
  <dt>SDK Platform</dt>
  <dd><strong>Required.</strong> At least one platform is required in your
environment to be able to compile your application. To provide the best user experience
on the latest devices, we recommend that you use the latest platform version as your build target.
You'll still be able to run your app on older versions, but you must build against the latest
version in order to use new features when running on devices with the latest version of Android.
  </dd>
  <dt>System Image</dt>
  <dd>Recommended. Although you might have one or more Android-powered devices on which to test
 your app, it's unlikely you have a device for every version of Android your app supports. It's
a good practice to download system images for all versions of Android that your
app supports and then test
your app against these Android versions by using the
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/emulator.html">Android Emulator</a>. Click <strong>Show Package Details</strong> to display the available
system images for each available platform. You can also download system images when creating
Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) in the
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/avd-manager.html">AVD Manager</a>. </dd>


  <dt>Android Support Repository</dt>
  <dd>Recommended. Includes a local Maven repository for the Android Data
  Binding Library, Android Testing Support Library, and Android Support
  Libraries. The Android Support Libraries provide an extended set of
  APIs that are compatible with most versions of Android. They're required for
  products such as <a href="{@docRoot}wear/index.html">Android Wear</a>, <a
  href="{@docRoot}tv/index.html">Android TV</a>, and <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/cast/">Google Cast</a>. For more
  information about each of the libraries in the Android Support Repository,
  see <a href="{@docRoot}tools/data-binding/guide.html">Data Binding Guide</a>,
  <a href="{@docRoot}tools/testing-support-library/index.html">Testing Support
  Library</a>, and <a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/index.html">Support
  Library</a>.</dd>

  <dt>Google Play services</dt>
  <dd>Recommended. Includes the Google Play services client library, which
  provides a variety of features and services for your
  apps, such as <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/">Google
  sign-in</a>, <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/">Google
  Maps</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/">Games
  achievements and leaderboards</a>, and much more.</dd>

  <dt>Google Repository</dt>
  <dd>Recommended. Includes local Maven repository for Google libraries.</dd>


<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> For easy access to the SDK tools from a command line, add the
location of the SDK <code>tools/</code> and
<code>platform-tools</code> to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>


<p>The previous list is not comprehensive and you can <a
href="#AddingSites">add new sites</a> to download additional packages from third parties.</p>

<p>In some cases, an SDK package may require a specific minimum revision of
another package or SDK tool. The SDK Manager automatically notifies you of any
dependencies and downloads the required packages or tools.
In addition, development tools notify you if there are dependencies that you need to
address. </p>



<h2 id="AddingSites">Adding New Sites</h2>

<p>The <strong>SDK Update Sites</strong> tab displays the sites that Android Studio checks for Android SDK
and third-party updates. You can add other sites that host their own Android SDK add-ons, and then
download the SDK add-ons from those sites.</p>

<p>For example, a mobile carrier or device manufacturer might offer additional
API libraries that are supported by their own Android-powered devices.
To develop using their libraries, you must install their Android SDK add-on, if it's not already
available as a third-party add-on.</p>

<p>If a carrier or device manufacturer has hosted an SDK add-on repository file
on their website, follow these steps to add their site to the Android SDK Manager:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <strong>SDK Update Sites</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add</strong> <img src="{@docRoot}images/tools/sdk-iadd.png" style="vertical-align:sub;margin:0;height:17px" alt="" />. </li>
  <li>Type the name and URL of the
    add-on site, and then cick <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>Make sure the checkbox is selected in the <strong>Enabled</strong> column.</li>

<p>Any SDK packages available from the site appear in the <strong>SDK Platforms</strong> or
<strong>SDK Tools</strong> tabs.</p>
</ol>
