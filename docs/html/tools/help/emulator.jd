<p>The Android SDK includes a mobile device emulator &mdash; a virtual mobile device
that runs on your computer. The emulator lets you develop and test
Android applications without using a physical device.</p>

<p>This page describes command line features that you can use with the
Android Emulator.
For information about using the Android Emulator UI, see
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/emulator.html">Using the Android Emulator</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="starting">Starting and Stopping the Emulator</h2>

<p>During development and testing of your application, you install and run your
application in the Android Emulator. You can launch the emulator as a standalone
application from a command line, or you can run it from within your Android Studio
development environment. In either case, you specify the AVD configuration to
load and any startup options you want to use, as described in this document.
</p>

<p>You can run your application on a single instance of the emulator or,
depending on your needs, you can start multiple emulator instances and run your
application in more than one emulated device. You can use the emulator's
built-in commands to simulate GSM phone calling or SMS between emulator
instances, and you can set up network redirection that allows emulators to send
data to one another. For more information, see <a href="#telephony">Telephony
Emulation</a>, <a href="#sms">SMS Emulation</a>, and
<a href="#emulatornetworking">Emulator Networking</a></p>

<p>To start an instance of the emulator from the command line, navigate to the
<code>tools/</code> folder of the SDK. Enter <code>emulator</code> command
like this: </p>

<pre>emulator -avd &lt;avd_name&gt; [&lt;options&gt;]</pre>

<p>This initializes the emulator, loads an AVD configuration and displays the emulator
window. For more information about command line options for the emulator, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/emulator.html">Android Emulator</a> tool reference.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can run multiple
instances of the emulator concurrently, each with its own AVD configuration and
storage area for user data, SD card, and so on.</p>

<p>When you run your app from Android Studio, it installs and launches the
app on your connected device or emulator (launching the emulator, if necessary).
You can specify emulator startup options in the Run/Debug
dialog, in the Target tab. When the emulator is running, you can issue
console commands as described later in this document.</p>

<p>If you are not working in Android Studio, see <a href="#apps">Installing Applications
on the Emulator</a> for information about how to install your application.</p>

<p>To stop an emulator instance, just close the emulator's window.</p>

<p>For a reference of the emulator's startup commands and keyboard mapping, see
the <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/emulator.html">Android Emulator</a> tool
reference.</p>


<h2 id="apps">Installing Applications on the Emulator</h2>

<p>If you don't have access to Android Studio, you can install your application on the
emulator using the <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adb.html#move">adb</a> utility. Before
installing the application, you need to build and package it into an <code>.apk</code> as described
in <a href="{@docRoot}tools/building/index.html">Building and
Running Apps</a>. Once the application is installed, you can start the emulator from the command
line as described previously, using any startup options necessary.
When the emulator is running, you can also connect to the emulator instance's
<a href="#console">console</a> to issue commands as needed.</p>

<p>As you update your code, you periodically package and install it on the emulator.
The emulator preserves the application and its state data across restarts,
in a user-data disk partition. To ensure that the application runs properly
as you update it, you may need to delete the emulator's user-data partition.
To do so, start the emulator with the <code>-wipe-data</code> option.
For more information about the user-data partition and other emulator storage,
see <a href="#diskimages">Working with Emulator Disk Images</a>.</p>

<h2 id="startup-options">Using Command Line Parameters</h2>

<p>The emulator supports a variety of options that you can specify
when launching the emulator, to control its appearance or behavior.
Here's the command-line syntax of the options available to the {@code emulator} program:</p>

<pre>emulator -avd &lt;avd_name&gt; [-&lt;option&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]] ... [-&lt;qemu args&gt;]</pre>

<h2 id="acceleration">Using Hardware Acceleration</h2>

<p>To make the Android emulator run faster and be more responsive, you can configure it to
take advantage of hardware acceleration, using a combination of configuration options, specific
Android system images and hardware drivers.</p>


<h3 id="accel-graphics">Configuring Graphics Acceleration</h3>

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> As of SDK Tools Revision 17, the graphics
acceleration feature for the emulator is experimental; be alert for incompatibilities and
errors when using this feature. </p>

<p>Graphics acceleration for the emulator takes advantage of your development computer's graphics
hardware, specifically its graphics processing unit (GPU), to make screen drawing faster. To use
the graphics acceleration feature, you must have the following versions of the Android development
tools installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android SDK Tools, Revision 17 or higher</li>
  <li>Android SDK Platform API 15, Revision 3 or higher</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/index.html#AddingComponents">Android SDK
Manager</a> to install these components:</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Not all applications are compatible with graphics hardware
acceleration. In particular, the Browser application and applications using the {@link
android.webkit.WebView} component are not compatible with graphics acceleration.</p>

<p>To configure an AVD to use graphics acceleration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have the required SDK components installed (listed above).</li>
  <li>Start the AVD Manager and create a new AVD with the <strong>Target</strong> value of
<strong>Android 4.0.3 (API Level 15)</strong>, revision 3 or higher.</li>
  <li>If you want to have graphics acceleration enabled by default for this AVD, in the
<strong>Hardware</strong> section, click <strong>New</strong>, select <strong>GPU emulation</strong>
and set the value to <strong>Yes</strong>.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also enable graphics acceleration when you
start an emulator using command line options as describe in the next section.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Name the AVD instance and select any other configuration options.
  <p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not select the <strong>Snapshot: Enabled</strong>
option. Snapshots are not supported for emulators with graphics acceleration enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create AVD</strong> to save the emulator configuration.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you set <strong>GPU emulation</strong> to <strong>Yes</strong> for your AVD, then graphics
acceleration is automatically enabled when you run it. If you did not enable <strong>GPU
emulation</strong> when you created the AVD, you can still enable it at runtime.</p>

<p>To enable graphics acceleration at runtime for an AVD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from the command line, just include the {@code -gpu on}
option:
<pre>emulator -avd &lt;avd_name&gt; -gpu on</pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must specify an AVD configuration that uses
Android 4.0.3 (API Level 15, revision 3) or higher system image target. Graphics acceleration is not
available for earlier system images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from Android Studio, run your Android application using an AVD
with the {@code -gpu on} option enabled:
    <ol>
      <li>In Android Studio, click your Android application module folder and then select
      <strong>Run > Edit Configurations...</strong></li>
      <li>In the left panel of the <strong>Run/Debug Configurations</strong> dialog, select your Android
      run configuration or create a new configuration.</li>
      <li>Under the <strong>Target Device </strong> options,
      select the AVD you created in the previous procedure.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Emulator</strong> tab, in the
      <strong>Additional command line options</strong> field, enter:<br>
        {@code -gpu on}</li>
      <li>Run your Android project using this run configuration.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="accel-vm">Configuring Virtual Machine Acceleration</h2>

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> As of SDK Tools Revision 17, the virtual machine
acceleration feature for the emulator is experimental; be alert for incompatibilities and errors
when using this feature.</p>

<p>Many modern CPUs provide extensions for running virtual machines (VMs) more efficiently. Taking
advantage of these extensions with the Android emulator requires some additional configuration of
your development system, but can significantly improve the execution speed. Before attempting to use
this type of acceleration, you should first determine if your development system’s CPU supports one
of the following virtualization extensions technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intel Virtualization Technology (VT, VT-x, vmx) extensions</li>
  <li>AMD Virtualization (AMD-V, SVM) extensions (only supported for Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>The specifications from the manufacturer of your CPU should indicate if it supports
virtualization extensions. If your CPU does not support one of these virtualization technologies,
then you cannot use virtual machine acceleration.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Virtualization extensions are typically enabled through
your computer's BIOS and are frequently turned off by default. Check the documentation for your
system's motherboard to find out how to enable virtualization extensions.</p>

<p>Once you have determined that your CPU supports virtualization extensions, make sure you can work
within these additional requirements of running an emulator inside an accelerated virtual
machine:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>x86 AVD Only</strong> - You must use an AVD that is uses an x86 system image target.
AVDs that use ARM-based system images cannot be accelerated using the emulator configurations
described here.</li>
  <li><strong>Not Inside a VM</strong> - You cannot run a VM-accelerated emulator inside another
virtual machine, such as a VirtualBox or VMWare-hosted virtual machine. You must run the emulator
directly on your system hardware.</li>
  <li><strong>Other VM Drivers</strong> - If you are running another virtualization technology on
your system such as VirtualBox or VMWare, you may need to unload the driver for that virtual machine
hosting software before running an accelerated emulator.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenGL&reg; Graphics</strong> - Emulation of OpenGL ES graphics may not perform at the
same level as an actual device.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use virtual machine acceleration with the emulator, you need the following version of Android
development tools. Use the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/index.html#AddingComponents">Android SDK
Manager</a> to install these components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android SDK Tools, Revision 17 or higher</li>
  <li>Android x86-based system image</li>
</ul>

<p>If your development environment meets all of the requirements for running a VM-accelerated
emulator, you can use the AVD Manager to create an x86-based AVD configuration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Android SDK Manager, make sure you have an x86-based <strong>System Image</strong>
    installed for your target Android version. If you do not have an x86 <strong>System
    Image</strong> installed, select one in the Android SDK Manager and install it.
    <p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> System images are listed under each API Level in the SDK
    Manager. An x86 system image may not be available for all API levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Start the AVD Manager and create a new AVD with an x86 value for the
<strong>CPU/ABI</strong> field. You may need to select a specific <strong>Target</strong> value, or
select a <strong>Target</strong> value and then select a specific <strong>CPU/ABI</strong>
option.</li>
  <li>Name the emulator instance and select any other configuration options.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create AVD</strong> to save the emulator configuration.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="vm-windows">Configuring VM Acceleration on Windows</h4>

<p>Virtual machine acceleration for Windows requires the installation of the Intel Hardware
Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel HAXM). The software requires an Intel CPU with
Virtualization Technology (VT) support and one of the following operating systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 7 (32/64-bit)</li>
  <li>Windows Vista (32/64-bit)</li>
  <li>Windows XP (32-bit only)</li>
</ul>

<p>To install the virtualization driver:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start the Android SDK Manager, select <strong>Extras</strong> and then select <strong>Intel
Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager</strong>.</li>
  <li>After the download completes, execute {@code
&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager/IntelHAXM.exe}.</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation.</li>
  <li>After installation completes, confirm that the virtualization driver is operating correctly by
opening a command prompt window and running the following command:
    <pre>sc query intelhaxm</pre>
    <p>You should see a status message including the following information:</p>
<pre>
SERVICE_NAME: intelhaxm
       ...
       STATE              : 4  RUNNING
       ...
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To run an x86-based emulator with VM acceleration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from the command line, just specify an x86-based AVD:
<pre>emulator -avd &lt;avd_name&gt;</pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must provide an x86-based AVD configuration
name, otherwise VM acceleration will not be enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from Android Studio, run your Android application with an x86-based
AVD:
    <ol>
      <li>In Android Studio, click your Android project folder and then select <strong>Run > Edit
Configurations...</strong></li>
      <li>In the left panel of the <strong>Run/Debug Configurations</strong> dialog, select your Android
run configuration or create a new configuration.</li>
      <li>Under the <strong>Target Device</strong> options, select the x86-based AVD you created
previously.</li>
      <li>Run your Android project using this run configuration.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can adjust the amount of memory available to the Intel HAXM kernel extension by re-running
its installer.</p>

<p>You can stop using the virtualization driver by uninstalling it. Re-run the installer or use
the Control Panel to remove the software.</p>


<h4 id="vm-mac">Configuring VM Acceleration on Mac</h4>

<p>Virtual machine acceleration on a Mac requires the installation of the Intel Hardware Accelerated
Execution Manager (Intel HAXM) kernel extension to allow the Android emulator to make use of CPU
virtualization extensions. The kernel extension is compatible with Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version
10.6.0) and higher.</p>

<p>To install the Intel HAXM kernel extension:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start the Android SDK Manager, select <strong>Extras</strong> and then select <strong>Intel
Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager</strong>.
  <li>After the download completes, execute
    {@code &lt;sdk&gt;/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager/IntelHAXM.dmg}.</li>
  <li>Double click the <strong>IntelHAXM.mpkg</strong> icon to begin installation.</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation.</li>
  <li>After installation completes, confirm that the new kernel extension is operating correctly by
opening a terminal window and running the following command:
    <pre>kextstat | grep intel</pre>
    <p>You should see a status message containing the following extension name, indicating that the
      kernel extension is loaded:</p>
    <pre>com.intel.kext.intelhaxm</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To run an x86-based emulator with VM acceleration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from the command line, just specify an x86-based AVD:
<pre>emulator -avd &lt;avd_name&gt;</pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must provide an x86-based AVD configuration
name, otherwise VM acceleration will not be enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from Andriod Studio, run your Android application with an x86-based
AVD:
    <ol>
      <li>In Android Studio, click your Android module folder and then select <strong>Run > Edit
Configurations...</strong></li>
      <li>In the left panel of the <strong>Run/Debug Configurations</strong> dialog, select your Android
run configuration or create a new configuration.</li>
      <li>Under the <strong>Target Device</strong> options,
      select the x86-based AVD you created previously.</li>
      <li>Run your Android project using this run configuration.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can adjust the amount of memory available to the Intel HAXM kernel extension by re-running
the installer.</p>

<p>You can stop using the virtualization kernel driver by uninstalling it. Before removing it, shut
down any running x86 emulators. To unload the virtualization kernel driver, run the following
command in a terminal window:</p>

<pre>sudo /System/Library/Extensions/intelhaxm.kext/Contents/Resources/uninstall.sh</pre>

<h4 id="vm-linux">Configuring VM Acceleration on Linux</h4>

<p>Linux-based systems support virtual machine acceleration through the KVM software package. Follow
<a href="https://www.google.com/?q=kvm+installation">instructions for installing KVM</a> on your
Linux system, and verify that KVM is enabled. In addition to following the installation
instructions, be aware of these configuration requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running KVM requires specific user permissions, make sure you have sufficient permissions
according to the KVM installation instructions.</li>
  <li>If you use another virtualization technology in your Linux platform, unload its kernel driver
before running the x86 emulator. For example, the VirtualBox driver program is {@code vboxdrv}.</li>
</ul>

<p>To run an x86-based emulator with VM acceleration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from the command line, start the emulator with an x86-based
AVD and include the KVM options:
<pre>emulator -avd &lt;avd_name&gt; -qemu -m 512 -enable-kvm</pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must provide an x86-based AVD configuration
name, otherwise VM acceleration will not be enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you are running the emulator from Android Studio, run your Android application with an
  x86-based AVD and include the KVM options:
    <ol>
      <li>In Android Studio, click your Android module folder and then select <strong>Run > Edit
Configurations...</strong></li>
      <li>In the left panel of the <strong>Run/Debug Configurations</strong> dialog, select your Android
run configuration or create a new configuration.</li>
      <li>Under the <strong>Target Device</strong> options, select the x86-based AVD you created
previously.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Emulator</strong> tab, in the
      <strong>Additional command line options</strong> field, enter:
      <pre>-qemu -m 512 -enable-kvm</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Run your Android project using this run configuration.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Important:</strong> When using the {@code -qemu} command line option, make sure
it is the last parameter in your command. All subsequent options are interpreted as qemu-specific
parameters.</p>


<h2 id="sdcard">Using SD Card Emulation</h2>

<p>You can create a disk image and then load it to the emulator at startup, to
simulate the presence of a user's SD card in the device. To do this, you can specify
an SD card image when you create an AVD, or you can use the mksdcard utility included
in the SDK.</p>

<p>The following sections describe how to create an SD card disk image, how to copy
files to it, and how to load it in the emulator at startup. </p>

<p>Note that you can only load a disk image at emulator startup. Similarly, you
can not remove a simulated SD card from a running emulator. However, you can
browse, send files to, and copy/remove files from a simulated SD card either
with adb or the emulator. </p>

<p>The emulator supports emulated SDHC cards, so you can create an SD card image
of any size up to 128 gigabytes.</p>


<h3 id="sdcard-creating">Creating an SD card image</h3>

<p>There are several ways of creating an SD card image. The easiest way is to use the
<strong>AVD Manager</strong> to create a new SD card by specifying a size when you create an AVD.
You can also use the {@code android} command line tool when creating an AVD. Just add the
<code>-c</code> option to your command: </p>

<pre>android create avd -n &lt;avd_name&gt; -t &lt;targetID&gt; -c &lt;size&gt;[K|M]</pre>

<p>The <code>-c</code> option can also be used to to specify a path to an SD card
image for the new AVD. For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/managing-avds-cmdline.html">Managing Virtual Devices
from the Command Line</a>.
</p>

<p>You can also use the mksdcard tool, included in the SDK, to create a FAT32 disk
image that you can load in the emulator at startup. You can access mksdcard in
the tools/ directory of the SDK and create a disk image like this: </p>

<pre>mksdcard &lt;size&gt; &lt;file&gt;</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>mksdcard 1024M sdcard1.iso</pre>

<p>For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/help/mksdcard.html"><code>mksdcard</code></a>.</p>


<h3 id="sdcard-files">Copying files to an SD card image</h3>

<p>Once you have created the disk image, you can copy files to it prior to
loading it in the emulator. To copy files, you can mount the image as a loop
device and then copy the files to it, or you can use a utility such as {@code mtools} to
copy the files directly to the image. The {@code mtools} package is available for Linux,
Mac, and Windows.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the {@code adb push} command to move files onto an SD card image
while it is loaded in an emulator. For more information see the <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adb.html#copyfiles">{@code adb push}</a> documentation.</p>

<h3 id="sdcard-loading">Loading an SD card image</h3>

<p>By default, the emulator loads the SD card image that is stored with the active
AVD (see the <code>-avd</code> startup option).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can start the emulator with the
<code>-sdcard</code> flag and specify the name and path of your image (relative
to the current working directory): </p>

<pre>emulator -sdcard &lt;filepath&gt;</pre>


<h2 id="diskimages">Working With Emulator Disk Images</h2>

<p>The emulator uses mountable disk images stored on your development machine to
simulate flash (or similar) partitions on an actual device. For example, it uses a
disk image containing an emulator-specific kernel, the Android system, a
ramdisk image, and writeable images for user data and simulated SD card.</p>

<p>To run properly, the emulator requires access to a specific set of disk image
files. By default, the Emulator always looks for the disk images in the
private storage area of the AVD in use. If no images exist there when
the Emulator is launched, it creates the images in the AVD directory based on
default versions stored in the SDK. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The default storage location for
AVDs is in <code>~/.android/avd</code> on OS X and Linux, <code>C:\Documents and
Settings\&lt;user&gt;\.android\</code> on Windows XP, and
<code>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\.android\</code>
on Windows Vista.</p>

<p>To let you use alternate or custom versions of the image files, the emulator
provides startup options that override the default locations and filenames of
the image files. When you use one of these options, the emulator searches for the image
file under the image name or location that you specify; if it can not locate the
image, it reverts to using the default names and location.</p>

<p>The emulator uses three types of image files: default image files, runtime
image files, and temporary image files. The sections below describe how to
override the location/name of each type of file. </p>

<h3 id="defaultimages">Default image files</h3>

<p>When the emulator launches, but does not find an existing user data image in
the active AVD's storage area, it creates a new one from a default version
included in the SDK. The default user data image is read-only. The image
files are read-only.</p>

<p>The emulator provides the <code>-system &lt;dir&gt;</code> startup option to
let you override the location where the emulator looks for the default
user data image. </p>

<p>The emulator also provides a startup option that lets you override the name
of the default user data image, as described in the following table. When you use the
option, the emulator looks in the default directory, or in a custom location
(if you specified <code>-system &lt;dir&gt;</code>). </p>

<h3 id="runtimeimages">Runtime images: user data and SD card</h3>

<p>At runtime, the emulator reads and writes data to two disk images: a
user-data image and (optionally) an SD card image. These images emulate the user-data
partition and removable storage media on actual device. </p>

<p>The emulator provides a default user-data disk image. At startup, the emulator
creates the default image as a copy of the system user-data image (user-data.img),
described above. The emulator stores the new image with the files of the active AVD.</p>

<!--
<p>The emulator provides a startup option, <code>-datadir &lt;dir&gt;</code>,
that you can use to override the location under which the emulator looks for the runtime
image files. </p>
-->

<p>The emulator provides startup options to let you override the actual names and storage
locations of the runtime images to load, as described in the following table. When you use one
of these options, the emulator looks for the specified file(s) in the current working directory,
in the AVD directory, or in a custom location (if you specified a path with the filename). </p>

the emulator looks for the file in the current working directory. If the file at <code>&lt;filepath&gt;</code> does
not exist, the emulator creates an image from the default <code>userdata.img</code>, stores it under the name you
specified, and persists user data to it at shutdown. </td>

</table>

<h4>User-Data Image</h4>

<p>Each emulator instance uses a writeable user-data image to store user- and
session-specific data. For example, it uses the image to store a unique user's
installed application data, settings, databases, and files. </p>

<p>At startup, the emulator attempts to load a user-data image stored during
a previous session. It looks for the file in the current working directory,
in the AVD directory described in a previous section and at the custom location/name
that you specified at startup. </p>

<ul>
<li>If it finds a user-data image, it mounts the image and makes it available
to the system for reading and writing of user data. </li>
<li>If it does not find one, it creates an image by copying the system user-data
image (userdata.img), described above. At device power-off, the system persists
the user data to the image, so that it will be available in the next session.
Note that the emulator stores the new disk image at the location/name that you
specify in <code>-data</code> startup option.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Because of the AVD configurations used in the emulator,
each emulator instance gets its own dedicated storage. There is no longer a need
to use the <code>-d</code> option to specify an instance-specific storage area.</p>

<h4>SD Card</h4>

<P>Optionally, you can create a writeable disk image that the emulator can use
to simulate removeable storage in an actual device. For information about how to create an
emulated SD card and load it in the emulator, see <a href="#sdcard">SD Card Emulation</a></p>

<p>You can also use the android tool to automatically create an SD Card image
for you, when creating an AVD. For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/managing-avds.html">Managing Virtual Devices with AVD
Manager</a>.


<h3 id="temporaryimages">Temporary Images</h3>

<p>The emulator creates two writeable images at startup that it deletes at
device power-off. The images are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>A writable copy of the Android system image</li>
  <li>The <code>/cache</code> partition image</li>
</ul>

<p>The emulator does not permit renaming the temporary system image or
persisting it at device power-off. </p>

<p>The <code>/cache</code> partition image is initially empty, and is used by
the browser to cache downloaded web pages and images. The emulator provides an
<code>-cache &lt;file&gt;</code>, which specifies the name of the file in which
to persist the <code>/cache</code> image at device power-off. If <code>&lt;file&gt;
</code> does not exist, the emulator creates it as an empty file. </p>

<p>You can also disable the use of the cache partition by specifying the
<code>-nocache</code> option at startup. </p>


<h2 id="emulatornetworking">Setting Up Emulator Networking</h2>

<p>The emulator provides versatile networking capabilities that you can use to
set up complex modeling and testing environments for your application. The
sections below introduce the emulator's network architecture and capabilities.
</p>

<h3 id="networkaddresses">Network Address Space</h3>

<p>Each instance of the emulator runs behind a virtual router/firewall service
that isolates it from your development machine's network interfaces and settings
and from the internet. An emulated device can not see your development machine
or other emulator instances on the network. Instead, it sees only that it is
connected through Ethernet to a router/firewall.</p>

<p>The virtual router for each instance manages the 10.0.2/24 network address
space &mdash; all addresses managed by the router are in the form of
10.0.2.&lt;xx&gt;, where &lt;xx&gt; is a number. Addresses within this space are
pre-allocated by the emulator/router as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Network Address</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10.0.2.1</td>
    <td>Router/gateway address </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Special alias to your host loopback interface (i.e., 127.0.0.1 on your
development machine)</td>
  </tr>

<p>Note that the same address assignments are used by all running emulator
instances. That means that if you have two instances running concurrently on
your machine, each will have its own router and, behind that, each will have an
IP address of 10.0.2.15. The instances are isolated by a router and can
<em>not</em> see each other on the same network. For information about how to
let emulator instances communicate over TCP/UDP, see <a
href="#connecting">Connecting Emulator Instances</a>.</p>

<p>Also note that the address 127.0.0.1 on your development machine corresponds
to the emulator's own loopback interface. If you want to access services running
on your development machine's loopback interface (a.k.a. 127.0.0.1 on your
machine), you should use the special address 10.0.2.2 instead.</p>

<p>Finally, note that each emulated device's pre-allocated addresses are
specific to the Android emulator and will probably be very different on real
devices (which are also very likely to be NAT-ed, i.e., behind a
router/firewall)</p>


<h3 id="networkinglimitations">Local Networking Limitations</h3>

<p>Android applications running in an emulator can connect to the network available on your
workstation. However, they connect through the emulator, not directly to hardware, and the emulator
acts like a normal application on your workstation. This means that the emulator, and thus your
Android applications, are subject to some limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communication with the emulated device may be blocked by a firewall
program running on your machine.</li>
  <li>Communication with the emulated device may be blocked by another
(physical) firewall/router to which your machine is connected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emulator's virtual router should be able to handle all outbound TCP and
UDP connections/messages on behalf of the emulated device, provided your
development machine's network environment allows it to do so. There are no
built-in limitations on port numbers or ranges except the one imposed by your
host operating system and network.</p>

<p>Depending on the environment, the emulator may not be able to support other
protocols (such as ICMP, used for "ping") might not be supported. Currently, the
emulator does not support IGMP or multicast. </p>

<h3 id="redirection">Using Network Redirection</h3>

<p>To communicate with an emulator instance behind its virtual router, you need
to set up network redirection on the virtual router. Clients can then connect
to a specified guest port on the router, while the router directs traffic
to/from that port to the emulated device's host port. </p>

<p>To set up the network redirection, you create a mapping of host and guest
ports/addresses on the emulator instance. There are two ways to set up
network redirection: using emulator console commands and using the ADB tool, as
described below. </p>


<h4 id="consoleredir">Setting up Redirection through the Emulator Console</h4>

<p>Each emulator instance provides a control console the you can connect to, to
issue commands that are specific to that instance. You can use the
<code>redir</code> console command to set up redirection as needed for an
emulator instance. </p>

<p>First, determine the console port number for the target emulator instance.
For example, the console port number for the first emulator instance launched is
5554. Next, connect to the console of the target emulator instance, specifying
its console port number, as follows: </p>

<pre><code>telnet localhost 5554</code></pre>

<p>Once connected, use the <code>redir</code> command to work with redirection.
To add a redirection, use:</p>

<pre><code>add&nbsp;&lt;protocol&gt;:&lt;host-port&gt;:&lt;guest-port&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>where <code>&lt;protocol&gt;</code> is either <code>tcp</code> or <code>udp</code>,
and <code>&lt;host-port&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;guest-port&gt;</code> sets the
mapping between your own machine and the emulated system, respectively. </p>

<p>For example, the following command sets up a redirection that handles all
incoming TCP connections to your host (development) machine on 127.0.0.1:5000
and will pass them through to the emulated system's 10.0.2.15:6000.:</p>

<pre>redir add tcp:5000:6000</pre>

<p>To delete a redirection, you can use the <code>redir del</code> command. To
list all redirection for a specific instance, you can use <code>redir
list</code>. For more information about these and other console commands, see
<a href="#console">Using the Emulator Console</a>. </p>

<p>Note that port numbers are restricted by your local environment. this typically
means that you cannot use host port numbers under 1024 without special
administrator privileges.  Also, you won't be able to set up a redirection for a
host port that is already in use by another process on your machine. In that
case, <code>redir</code> generates an error message to that effect. </p>

<h4 id="adbredir">Setting Up Redirection through ADB</h4>

<p>The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool provides port forwarding, an alternate
way for you to set up network redirection. For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adb.html#forwardports">Forwarding Ports</a> in the ADB
documentation.</p>

<p>Note that ADB does not currently offer any way to remove a redirection,
except by killing the ADB server.</p>


<h3 id="dns">Configuring the Emulator's DNS Settings</h3>

<p>At startup, the emulator reads the list of DNS servers that your system is
currently using. It then stores the IP addresses of up to four servers on this
list and sets up aliases to them on the emulated addresses 10.0.2.3, 10.0.2.4,
10.0.2.5 and 10.0.2.6 as needed.  </p>

<p>On Linux and OS X, the emulator obtains the DNS server addresses by parsing
the file <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. On Windows, the emulator obtains the
addresses by calling the <code>GetNetworkParams()</code> API. Note that this
usually means that the emulator ignores the content of your "hosts" file
(<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Linux/OS X, <code>%WINDOWS%/system32/HOSTS</code>
 on Windows).</P>

<p>When starting the emulator at the command line, you can also use the
<code>-dns-server &lt;serverList&gt;</code> option to manually specify the
addresses of DNS servers to use, where &lt;serverList&gt; is a comma-separated
list of server names or IP addresses. You might find this option useful if you
encounter DNS resolution problems in the emulated network (for example, an
"Unknown Host error" message that appears when using the web browser).</p>


<h3 id="proxy">Using the Emulator with a Proxy</h3>

<p>If your emulator must access the Internet through a proxy server, you can use
the <code>-http-proxy &lt;proxy&gt;</code> option when starting the emulator, to
set up the appropriate redirection. In this case, you specify proxy information
in <code>&lt;proxy&gt;</code> in one of these formats:</p>

<pre>http://&lt;machineName&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>http://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;machineName&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>-http-proxy</code> option forces the emulator to use the specified
HTTP/HTTPS proxy for all outgoing TCP connections. Redirection for UDP is not
currently supported.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can define the environment variable
<code>http_proxy</code> to the value you want to use for
<code>&lt;proxy&gt;</code>. In this case, you do not need to specify a value for
<code>&lt;proxy&gt;</code> in the <code>-http-proxy</code> command &mdash; the
emulator checks the value of the <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable at
startup and uses its value automatically, if defined. </p>

<p>You can use the <code>-verbose-proxy</code> option to diagnose proxy
connection problems.</p>


<h3 id="connecting">Interconnecting Emulator Instances</h3>

<p>To allow one emulator instance to communicate with another, you must set up
the necessary network redirection as illustrated below. </p>

<p>Assume that your environment is</p>

<ul>
  <li>A is you development machine</li>
  <li>B is your first emulator instance, running on A</li>
  <li>C is your second emulator instance, also running on A</li>
</ul>

<p>and you want to run a server on B, to which C will connect, here is how you
could set it up: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up the server on B, listening to
<code>10.0.2.15:&lt;serverPort&gt;</code></li>
  <li>On B's console, set up a redirection from
<code>A:localhost:&lt;localPort&gt;</code> to <code>
B:10.0.2.15:&lt;serverPort&gt;</code></li>
  <li>On C, have the client connect to <code>10.0.2.2:&lt;localPort&gt;</code></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if you wanted to run an HTTP server, you can select
<code>&lt;serverPort&gt;</code> as 80 and <code>&lt;localPort&gt;</code> as
8080:</p>

<ul>
  <li>B listens on 10.0.2.15:80</li>
  <li>On B's console, issue <code>redir add tcp:8080:80</code></li>
  <li>C connects to 10.0.2.2:8080</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="calling">Sending a Voice Call or SMS to Another Emulator Instance</h3>

<p>The emulator automatically forwards simulated voice calls and SMS messages from one instance to
another. To send a voice call or SMS, use the dialer application or SMS application, respectively,
from one of the emulators.</p>

<p>To initiate a simulated voice call to another emulator instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the dialer application on the originating emulator instance.</li>
<li>As the number to dial, enter the console port number of the instance you'd like to call. You can determine
  the console port number of the target instance by checking its window title, where the
  console port number is reported as "Android Emulator (&lt;port&gt;). </li>
<li>Press "Dial". A new inbound call appears in the target emulator instance. </li>
</ol>

<p>To send an SMS message to another emulator instance, launch the SMS application (if available). Specify the console port number of the target emulator instance as as the SMS address, enter the message text, and send the message. The message is delivered to the target emulator instance. </p>

<p>You can also connect to an emulator instance's console to simulate an incoming voice call or SMS. For more information, see <a href="#telephony">Telephony Emulation</a> and <a href="#sms">SMS Emulation</a>.


<h2 id="console">Using the Emulator Console</h2>

<p>Each running emulator instance provides a console that lets you query and control the emulated
device environment. For example, you can use the console to manage port redirection, network
characteristics, and telephony events while your application is running on the emulator.

<h3 id="console-session">Starting and Stopping a Console Session</h2>
<p>To access the console and enter commands, from a terminal window, use <code>telnet</code> to
connect to the
console port and provide your authentication token.</p>


<p>To connect to the console of a running emulator instance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window and enter the following command: </li>

<pre>telnet localhost <em>console-port</em></pre>

<p>An emulator instance occupies a pair of adjacent ports: a console port and an <code>adb</code> port.
The port numbers differ by 1, with the <code>adb</code> port having the higher port number. The console
of the first emulator instance running on a particular machine uses console port 5554 and <code>adb</code>
port 5555. Subsequent instances use port numbers increasing by two &mdash; for example, 5556/5557,
5558/5559, and so on. Up to 16 concurrent emulator instances can run a console facility. </p>

<p>To connect to the emulator console, you must specify a valid console port. If multiple emulator
  instances are running, you need to determine the console port of the emulator instance you want
  to connect to. The emulator window title lists the console port number. For example, the
  window title for an emulator using console port 5554
  could be <code>5554:Nexus_5X_API_23</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>adb devices</code> command, which prints a list of
  running emulator instances and their console port numbers. For more information, see
  <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adb.html#devicestatus">Querying for Emulator/Device Instances</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">Note: The emulator listens for connections on ports 5554 to 5587 and accepts
  connections from localhost only.</p>

<li>After the console displays <code>OK</code>, enter the <code>auth
<em>auth_token</em></code> command.</li>

<p>Before you can enter console commands, the emulator console requires authentication.
  <code><em>auth_token</em></code> must
  match the contents of the <code>.emulator_console_auth_token</code> file in your home directory.
</p>

<p>If that file doesn't exist, the <code>telnet localhost <em>console-port</em></code>
  command creates the file, which contains a randomly generated authentication token.</p>

<p>To disable authentication, delete the token from the
  <code>.emulator_console_auth_token</code> file or create an empty file if it doesn't exist.</p>

<li>After you're connected to the console, enter console commands.</li>

<p>Enter <code>help</code> and <code>help <em>command</em></code> to see a
  list of console commands and learn about specific commands.</p>

<li>To exit the console session, enter <code>quit</code> or <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example session:</p>

<p>The following sections describe the major functional areas of the console.</p>


<h3 id="portredirection">Port Redirection</h3>

<p>You can use the console to add and remove port redirection while the emulator is running. After
you connect to the console, manage port redirection by entering the following command:</p>

<pre>redir &lt;list|add|del&gt; </pre>

<p>The <code>redir</code> command supports the subcommands listed in the table below. </p>

  <td>Delete a port redirection.</td>
<td>The meanings of &lt;protocol&gt; and &lt;host-port&gt; are listed in the previous row.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3 id="geo">Geo Location Provider Emulation</h3>

<p>You can use the console to set the geographic location reported to the applications running
inside an emulator. Use the <code>geo</code> command to send a simple GPS fix to the
emulator, with or without NMEA 1083 formatting:</p>

<pre>geo &lt;fix|nmea&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>geo</code> command supports the subcommands listed in the table below.</p>

<table>

  <tr>
    <td><code>fix &lt;longitude&gt; &lt;latitude&gt; [&lt;altitude&gt;]</code></td>
    <td>Send a simple GPS fix to the emulator instance.</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>You can issue the <code>geo</code> command as soon as an emulator instance is running. The
emulator sets the location you enter by creating a mock location provider. This provider responds to
location listeners set by applications, and also supplies the location to the {@link
android.location.LocationManager}. Any application can query the location manager to obtain the
current GPS fix for the emulated device by calling:

<pre>LocationManager.getLastKnownLocation("gps")</pre>

<p>For more information about the Location Manager, see {@link android.location.LocationManager}.
</p>

<h3 id="events">Hardware Events Emulation</h3>

<p>The {@code event} console commands sends hardware events to the emulator. The syntax for this
command is as follows:</p>

<pre>event &lt;send|types|codes|text&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>event</code> command supports the subcommands listed in the table below. </p>

</table>


<h3 id="netstatus">Network Status</h3>

<p>You can use the console to check the network status and current delay and speed characteristics. To do so, connect to the console and use the <code>netstatus</code> command. Here's an example of the command and its output. </p>

<pre>network status
</pre>


<h3 id="netdelay">Network Delay Emulation</h3>

<p>The emulator lets you simulate various network latency levels, so that you can test your
application in an environment more typical of the actual conditions in which it will run. You can
set a latency level or range at emulator startup or you can use the console to change the latency,
while the application is running in the emulator. </p>

<p>To set latency at emulator startup, use the  <code>-netdelay</code> emulator option with a
supported <code>&lt;delay&gt;</code> value, as listed in the table below. Here are some
examples:</p>

<pre>emulator -netdelay gprs
emulator -netdelay 40 100</pre>

<p>To make changes to  network delay while the emulator is running, connect to the console and use
the <code>netdelay</code> command with a supported <code>&lt;delay&gt;</code> value from the table
below.</p>

<pre>network delay gprs</pre>

<p>The format of network &lt;delay&gt; is one of the following (numbers are milliseconds):</p>

<table style="clear:right;width:100%;">
<tr>
  <th width="30%" >Value</th>
  <th width="35%" >Description</th><th width="35%">Comments</th></tr>

<td>Emulate an specified latency range (min, max milliseconds).</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>


<h3 id="netspeed">Network Speed Emulation</h3>

<p>The emulator also lets you simulate various network transfer rates.
You can set a transfer rate or range at emulator startup or you can use the console to change the
rate, while the application is running in the emulator.</p>

<p>To set the network speed at emulator startup, use the  <code>-netspeed</code> emulator option with a supported
<code>&lt;speed&gt;</code> value, as listed in the table below. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>emulator -netspeed gsm
emulator -netspeed 14.4 80</pre>

<p>To make changes to network speed while the emulator is running, connect to the console and use
the <code>netspeed</code> command with a supported <code>&lt;speed&gt;</code> value from the table
below.</p>

<pre>network speed 14.4 80</pre>

<p>The format of network <code>&lt;speed&gt;</code> is one of the following (numbers are

<h3 id="telephony">Telephony Emulation</h3>

<p>The Android emulator includes its own GSM emulated modem that lets you simulate telephony
functions in the emulator. For example, you can simulate inbound phone calls, establish data
connections and terminate them. The Android system handles simulated calls exactly as it would
actual calls. The emulator does not support call audio.</p>

<p>You can use the {@code gsm} command to access the emulator's telephony functions after connecting
to the console. The syntax for this command is as follows:</p>

<pre>gsm &lt;call|accept|busy|cancel|data|hold|list|voice|status&gt; </pre>

<p>The <code>gsm</code> command supports the subcommands listed in the table below. </p>

<h3 id="sms">SMS Emulation</h3>

<p>The Android emulator console lets you generate an SMS message and direct it to an emulator
instance. Once you connect to an emulator instance, you can generate an emulated incoming SMS using
the following command:</p>

<pre>sms send &lt;senderPhoneNumber&gt; &lt;textmessage&gt;</pre>

<p>where <code>&lt;senderPhoneNumber&gt;</code> contains an arbitrary numeric string. </p>

<p>The console forwards the SMS message to the Android framework, which passes it through to an application that handles that message type. </p>


<h3 id="vm">VM State</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>vm</code> command to control the VM on an emulator instance. The syntax for
this command is as follows: </p>

<pre>vm &lt;start|stop|status&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>vm</code> command supports the subcommands listed in the table below. </p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th width="25%">Subcommand</th>
  <th width="30%">Description</th>
  <th width="35%">Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>start</code></td>
    <td>Start the VM on the instance. </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>stop</code></td>
    <td>Stop the VM on the instance. </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>start</code></td>
    <td>Display the current status of the VM (running or stopped). </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3 id="window">Emulator Window</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>window</code> command to manage the emulator window. The syntax for this
command is as follows: </p>

<pre>window &lt;scale&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>vm</code> command supports the subcommands listed in the table below. </p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th width="25%">Subcommand</th>
  <th width="30%">Description</th>
  <th width="35%">Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code>scale &lt;scale&gt;</code></td>
    <td>Scale the emulator window.</td>
  <td>A number between 0.1 and 3 that sets the scaling factor. You can
  also specify scale as a DPI value if you add the suffix "dpi" to the scale value. A value of "auto"
  tells the emulator to select the best window size.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3 id="terminating">Terminating an Emulator Instance</h3>

<p>You can terminate an emulator instance through the console, using the <code>kill</code> command.</p>




<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Emulator Problems</h2>

<p>The {@code adb} utility sees the emulator as an actual physical device. For this reason, you
might have to use the {@code -d} flag with some common {@code adb} commands, such as
<code>install</code>. The {@code -d} flag lets you specify which of several connected devices to use
as the target of a command. If you don't specify {@code -d}, the emulator targets the first
device in its list. For more information about {@code adb}, see <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>For emulators running on Mac OS X, if you see an error {@code Warning: No DNS servers found}
when starting the emulator, check to see whether you have an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file. If
not, please run the following line in a command window:</p>
    <pre>ln -s /private/var/run/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

<p>See <a href="{@docRoot}resources/faq/index.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for more
troubleshooting information. </p>
