  <p>An Android Virtual Device (AVD) definition lets you define the
  characteristics of an Android phone, tablet, Android Wear, or Android TV
  device that you want to simulate in the
 <a href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/emulator.html">Android Emulator</a>.
  The AVD Manager helps you easily create and manage AVDs. </p>

  <p>To effectively test your app, you should create an AVD that models each
  device type that your app is designed to support. For example, we recommend
  that you create an AVD for each API level that's equal to and higher than the
  minimum version you've specified in your manifest
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html"
  style="white-space: nowrap;"
  >{@code &lt;uses-sdk>}</a> tag.</p>

  <p>An AVD contains a hardware profile, system image, skin, and other
  properties.</p>

  <p>The hardware profile defines the characteristics of a device as
  shipped from the factory. The AVD Manager comes preloaded with certain
  hardware profiles, such as Nexus phone devices, and you can define and import
  hardware profiles as needed. You can override some of the settings in your
  AVD, if needed.</p>

  <p>The AVD Manager helps you choose a system image for your AVD by providing
  recommendations. It also lets
  you download system images, some with add-on libraries, like Google APIs,
  which your app might require. x86 system images run the fastest in the
  emulator. Android Wear and Android TV devices tend to run best (and have
  the largest installed base) on recent releases, while users of Android phones
  and tablets tend to use slightly older releases, as shown in the
  <a href="{@docRoot}about/dashboards/index.html">API level
  dashboards</a>.</p>

  <p>An emulator skin specifies the appearance of a device. The AVD Manager
  provides some predefined skins. You can also define your own, or use skins
  provided by third parties.</p>

  <p>Just as with a real device, for apps to use certains features defined in an
  AVD, such as the camera, it must have the corresponding
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html"><code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code></a>
  setting in the app manifest.</p>

<h2 id="viewing">Viewing and Managing Your AVDs</h2>

<p>The AVD Manager lets you manage your AVDs all in one place.</p>

<p>To run the AVD Manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li> In Android Studio, select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt;
  <strong>Android</strong> &gt; <strong>AVD Manager</strong>.</li>
  <li> Click AVD Manager <img src="{@docRoot}images/tools/avd-manager-studio.png"
  style="vertical-align:sub;margin:0;height:17px" alt="AVD Manager icon">
  in the toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The AVD Manager appears.</p>

<img src="{@docRoot}images/tools/avd-main.png" alt="AVD Manager main window" />

<p>It displays any AVDs you’ve already defined. When you first install
Android Studio, it creates one AVD. If you defined AVDs for Android Emulator
24.0.<em>x</em> or lower, you need to recreate them.</p>

<p>From this page you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Define a new <a href="#createavd">AVD</a> or
  <a href="#createhp">hardware profile</a>.</li>
  <li> Edit an existing <a href="#workingavd">AVD</a> or
  <a href="#workinghp">hardware profile</a>.</li>
  <li> Delete an <a href="#workingavd">AVD</a> or

  <li> <a href="#importexporthp">Import or export</a> hardware profile
  definitions.</li>
  <li> <a href="#emulator">Run</a> an AVD to start the emulator.</li>
  <li> <a href="#emulator">Stop</a> an emulator.</li>
  <li> <a href="#emulator">Clear</a> data and start fresh, from the same state

  <h2 id="createavd">Creating an AVD</h2>

  <p>You can <a href="#newavd">create a new AVD</a> from the beginning, or
  <a href="#copyavd">duplicate an AVD</a> and change some properties.</p>

  <p id="newavd">To create a new AVD:</p>

<h2 id="skins">Creating Emulator Skins</h2>

<p>An Android emulator skin is a collection of files that define the visual
and control elements of
an emulator display. If the skin definitions available in the AVD settings
don't meet your requirements,
you can create your own custom skin definition, and then apply it to your AVD.
</p>

<p>Each emulator skin contains:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>A <code>hardware.ini</code> file</li>
      <li>Layout files for supported orientations (landscape, portrait) and
      physical configuration</li>
      <li>Image files for display elements, such as background, keys and
      buttons</li>
    </ul>
<p>To create and use a custom skin:</p>
 <ol>
    <li>Create a new directory where you will save your skin configuration
    files. </li>
    <li>Define the visual appearance of the skin in a text file named
    <code>layout</code>. This file defines many characteristics of the skin,
    such as the
    size and image assets for specific buttons. For example:
<pre class="no-prettyprint">
parts {
    device {
        display {
            width   320
            height  480
            x       0
            y       0
        }
    }

    portrait {
        background {
            image background_port.png
        }

        buttons {
            power {
                image  button_vertical.png
                x 1229
                y 616
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
</pre></li>

  <li>Add the bitmap files of the device images in the same directory.</li>
  <li>Specify additional hardware-specific device configurations in a
  <code>hardware.ini</code>
  file for the device settings, such as <code>hw.keyboard</code> and
  <code>hw.lcd.density</code>.</li>
  <li>Archive the files in the skin folder and select the archive file as a
  custom skin.</li>
</ol>
