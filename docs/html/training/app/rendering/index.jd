<p>The most common performance problems are related to how your app draws, and how that
  eventually appears on the user's screen.</p>

  <p><b>Finding rendering problems</b> is an iterative process of using hands-on testing to
  identify problem spots, harness tools to discover the underlying cause, and improve your code.
  See also <a href="{@docRoot}/training/app/approach.html">
  Test Your App's Performance</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Optimizing rendering performance</b> means to remove unnecessary work, simplify structures
  and processes, manage bitmaps properly, and be mindful of the natural constraints imposed by the
  hardware and the Android system.</p>

  <p><b>The result of great rendering performance</b> is instantly INVISIBLE to your users. That
  is, your app runs so fast and smoothly, that users fully focus on their task, not on your
  app's UI and performance.</p>

  <p>You can test for and improve common rendering problems by using the tools and strategies
  recommended in this course.</p>
