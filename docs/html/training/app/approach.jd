<p>Your app has a performance problem if it does not instantly respond
to a user action, stutters, or makes the user wait at any point.
This lesson introduces the most basic performance test for your app,
and a process for iteratively finding and fixing performance problems. </p>


<h2><img class="app-icon" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_gather.png">
    Litmus test your app</h2>

  <p>To find out whether your app has performance issues, you don't need fancy
  tools. </p>

  <p>Do the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install your app on the lowest-end device that your target audience might have.</li>

    <li>Use your app as a user would, and keep detailed notes on even the smallest wait, stutter,
    or unresponsiveness. Watch out for increasing slowness over time.</li>

    <li>Hand the device to a friend and take notes while they are using it.</li>

    <li>If you would like feedback from a larger audience, consider running a mini-usability test,
    such as described in
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YL0xoSmyZI">
        Guerilla Testing with Usability Cafe</a>.</li>

  </ol>


<h2><img class="app-icon" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_insight.png">
    Approach performance problems methodically</h2>

  <p><b>If these hands-on tests didn't reveal any performance problems,</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>you could do nothing further, or</li>

    <li>you can dive deeper and make your app perform even better. This could benefit users with
    slower connections or on simpler devices, and increase your potential audience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>If you gathered any notes related to performance, then performance is a problem for your
  app.</b></p>

  <p>Once you have subjectively established that your app could benefit from performance tuning, we
  have two recommendations for an objective and systematic approach to finding and fixing
  performance problems faster.</p>



  <h3>1. Use performance profiling tools</h3>

  <p>Android and Android Studio come with many
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/performance/index.html">
      performance profiling tools</a>
  to help you
  identify performance problems and track down where they are in your code. And after you have
  changed your code, run the tools again to measure the impact of your change. Compare results to
  make sure you've fixed the right problem, and find out whether you need to
  make additional performance improvements.</p>

  <p>To learn more about why you should use tools, see
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA4j6KKjMRk">Tools Not Rules</a>.</p>

  <h3>2. Follow the Performance Tuning Lifecycle</h3>

  <p>When optimizing your application, you must be able to measure its state, make changes, and
  then evaluate the performance differences of these changes. Thus, the Performance Tuning
  Lifecycle is built around the concept of "What you can measure, you can
  optimize".</p>

  <p>The Performance Tuning Lifecycle (Figure 1), consists of three phases:
  gather information, gain insight, and take action.</p>

  <p><b>
  <img class="app-icon-small" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_gather.png">
  Gather Information.</b> <br>
  Use the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/performance/index.html">
      performance profiling tools</a>
     to capture data
  about your app. Since most tools are specialized, you may need to run several tools.</p>

  <p><b>
  <img class="app-icon-small" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_insight.png">
  Gain Insight.</b><br>
   Take the time to understand what your gathered data means for your app.
  You may need to go through several iterations of gathering information and gaining insight to
  pinpoint what the problem (or problems!) is.</p>

  <p><b>
  <img class="app-icon-small" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_action.png">
  Take Action.</b><br>
  Take all the information and all the insights, and determine and evaluate
  different ways to solve your problem. Taking action can take different forms, and what you decide
  to do depends on your situation and context, which may also include coding resources, budgets,
  and deadlines.</p>

  <p>And once you've taken action, verify that your changes had the desired
  outcome:</p>

  <p>
  <img class="app-icon-inline" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_gather.png">
  Gather a second set of data.
  <img class="app-icon-inline" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_insight.png">
  Compare it to your original data.
  <img class="app-icon-inline" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_action.png">
  Make more changes...
  and repeat this process until your app consistently responds smoothly to all user actions, never
  stutters, and never makes the user wait. On all target devices.</p>

<h2><img class="app-icon" src="{@docRoot}images/training/app/app_icon_action.png">
    Start improving performance</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>If your notes include problems with the speed or smoothness of animations, or the app does
    not consistently respond to user input, start with
    <a href="{@docRoot}training/app/rendering/index.html">
    Optimizing Rendering Performance</a>.</li>

    <li>If your app uses the GPS or mobile radio, or makes a lot of networking calls, check

        Optimizing Battery Performance</a>.</li>
