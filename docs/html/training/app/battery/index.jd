  Users want their devices to run as long as possible on a single charge of battery. As an app
  developer, you should strive to make your app draw the minimum amount of power from the battery
  without sacrificing responsiveness, speed or latency for the user. You can take steps to optimize
  your app for maximum battery life by following the guidelines in this course. In many cases,
  you can minimize battery consumption and still get the same amount of work done by being
  more efficient.

  When users notice their battery does not get them through the day, they commonly check their
  device's Settings to find the offending app, where they can easily uninstall it. You should
  analyze your app to see if it is a leading source of battery drain, and take steps to prevent
  excessive battery consumption.
