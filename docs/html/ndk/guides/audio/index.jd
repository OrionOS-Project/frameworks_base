page.title=NDK Audio: OpenSL ES&#8482
@jd:body

<p>The NDK package includes an Android-specific implementation of the
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/opensles/">OpenSL ES</a> API
specification from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org">Khronos Group</a>. This library
allows you to use C or C++ to implement high-performance, low-latency audio in your game or other
demanding app.</p>

<p>This section begins by providing some
<a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/audio/basics.html">basic information</a> about the API, including how
to incorporate it into your app. It then explains what you need to know about the
<a href="{@docRoot}ndk/guides/audio/opensl-for-android.html">Android-specific implementation</a>
of OpenSL ES, focusing on differences between this implementation and the reference specification.
